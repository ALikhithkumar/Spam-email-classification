# Spam-email-classification

This project implements a spam classifier using a Decision Tree model. It reads a dataset of text messages, preprocesses the text, and trains a Decision Tree model to classify messages as either spam or ham.

Features
Text Cleaning: The text data is preprocessed, removing unnecessary elements.

Decision Tree Models: Two models are trained using Gini Index and Entropy criteria.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Text data is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF.
